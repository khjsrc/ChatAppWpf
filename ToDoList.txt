Current status: Clients are able to connect to the Server, send messages and receive messages from the Server.

Things that I need to do in future:
0. User authentication and where and how to store their credentials.
1. Remove clients from clients list by invoking an EventHandler or by a method that will call the EventHandler in the end? The (bad or good?) part of invoking the EventHandler is it'll have to have a method subscribed to it from the same class, i.e. the Event will never be null.
	1.1. Add "heartbeat" packets that will be sending by every client to the server to show that they're still connected and when X amount of these packets are lost, disconnect the client.
	1.2. Check if the data sent by the server can reach a client from the list of clients. If not - remove it from the list. (Try/Catch/Finally?)
2. Broadcast messages received by the server side to all other clients.
3. A better way of distinguishing clients from each other.
4. DO NOT USE Thread.Sleep() in async methods.
5. User and Message classes are not finished, but I don't know what to do with them yet.
6. Make everything fancy and user-friendly.
7. I bet there's more...
